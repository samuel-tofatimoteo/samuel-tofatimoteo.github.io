        <h2>Was blocked on a simple problem and elegantly solved it</h2>
        
        <p>
          I was stuck on a problem on a coding exercise where I was calling an object, before declaring that object. It’s kind of like reading a story and then all of a sudden some random character (object), out of the blue, was a part of the story the whole time. At first you're confused, but then you read a little more and then you start to understand that random character (object).
        </p>
        <p>
          I wasn’t understanding why the code couldn’t just keep on reading after calling the object, it would have found the whole explanation of the object. Like duhh? It’s righttt there?. Thinking like this was getting me nowhere, so I had to think really hard on solving the problem.
        </p>
        <p>
          First thing I did was take a nap, thinking about thinking hard made me not want to do that at the time. So I legit slept on it, and I am glad I did that. Because when I came to solving the problem, I had a fresh mind and perspective to tackle the problem.
        </p>
        <p>
          So I reread the exercise and code, followed through with my own steps so I could clarify my thoughts at the time when answering. That was it, from there I realized that it was the way I answered. I was looking at my own code as a test marker, thinking ‘why would you answer it like this?’. I realized I had answered multiple questions as a whole and not individually.  Which made me trip myself up, by accessing an object before declaring it in that answer.
        </p>
        <p>So instead of answering it as a whole, I answered each individual question. So if I myself viewed it as a marker, I could easily view it and in turn the code became readable.</p>
        <p>
          Throughout the process it was a little tedious but fun at the same time. It was a fun challenge to see how a programme reads what you make and then tells you ‘you make no sense’ with an error message.
        </p>
        <p>
          This little problem helped me understand even the simplest little bugs can happen to anyone no matter how good you think you are at coding. Making sure you have solid problem solving skills not only in coding, can really help get through a problem and maybe find a better solution. Having experienced this problem will help me later down the line when a similar problem comes about, I would gain experience and effectively use my problem solving techniques to tackle any problem that comes my way.
        </p>

        <h2>Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <h3>
              Pseudocode
            </h3>
          </li>
          <p>
            A little confident, I feel like I could trip myself up on a code that I’m not confident in knowledge wise.
          </p>
          <li>
            <h3>
              Trying something
            </h3>
          </li>
          <p>
            Very confident. I’m always giving something a try, I would only do this for quick trial and errors. Just to find out why I got something wrong or unintentionally got something right.
          </p>
          <li>
            <h3>Rubber ducky method</h3>
          </li>
          <p>
            Very confident. I like you using mainly the focus of the technique, which is to bring a different perspective to a problem. Helps me to give insight on a problem I would have never seen by just staring at it.
          </p>
          <li>
            <h3>Reading error messages</h3>
          </li>
          <p>
            Very Confident. Definitely like to read the error messages so I can get an understanding from the code programmes view of what went wrong. Then find and assess that error’s problem.
          </p>
          <li>
            <h3>Console.logging</h3>
          </li>
          <p>
            Little Confidence. I barely use console.logging, I don’t think I have gone through an exercise on using it frequently. I kind of don’t know when to use it at the right time as well.
          </p>
          <li>
            <h3>
              Googling
            </h3>
          </li>
          <p>
            Very Confident. I am always googling something I don’t understand, usually small things like coding terms. Control flow, declare, Value and more where is usually in exercise questions and video tutorials.
          </p>
          <li>
            <h3>
              Asking Peers for help
            </h3>
          </li>
          <p>
            Little Confidence. I still haven’t asked any of my peers for help yet, I feel like asking a teacher or the facilitator is the better alternative. But when it comes to more perspectives, I feel like it would be better to ask peers for help.
          </p>
          <li>
            <h3>
              Asking Coaches for help
            </h3>
            <p>
              Very Confident. I’m always keen to ask for help from coaches. I always feel a little more confident when I have someone around there that can help you, especially in an area I’m less knowledgeable in than them.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>
              Improving my process with reflection
            </h3>
          </li>
          <p>
            Very Confident. With all the frequent reflection during foundations, has helped implement it into my problem solving mentally. When problems arise, it really takes on you emotionally and mentally. Having reflection can really help me get through it.
          </p>

          <h2>
            Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what made you reluctant to do so. What might you try differently next time?
          </h2>
          <p>
            When I saw other peers in the cohort with their amazing looking personal blog websites. I really wanted to ask how they made some features on their website, so I could get some ideas for mine and learn more about those unknown to me. There were many factors that made me reluctant to ask.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some of them were, I’m just too introverted to ask, I feel like I'm bothering them when we all are focusing on sprints, I could legit look at how they did it through chrome devtools and many more. I think it was the amount of factors that ultimately made me reluctant. Maybe if it was one or two I would feel less reluctant to ask.
          </p>
          <p>
            Next time when asking for help, I would probably just assess there and then if it’s a quick question or not. I think the amount of time thinking on factors will affect the amount of factors that can make me reluctant to ask. So if it’s a quick effective question to get a quick effective answer, when we have a lot of time, then I’m definitely going to ask. If it isn’t and we have very little time, then it's best not to.
