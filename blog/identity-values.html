        <h2>Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.</h2>
        <p>Nothing significant is coming to mind atm, might change this one when I find a good one to discuss about.</p>
        <p>After a family event (I have a big family), all my close cousins around the same age decided to go out in town to keep the good vibes rolling. But one cousin got very drunk at our pre-drinks, in an annoying, uncontrollable state and still suggested she still wanted to come. We all collectively knew, ‘she ain’t coming out’. At this time, our rides into town were on-way and this socially formed 2 groups. Group A, the smaller group, the ones who wanted to take care of ‘very drunk cousin’. Group B, the larger group and the ones who wanted to sneak out now without group A from knowing. Now I’m quite close to ‘very drunk cousin’ and consider her an older sister to me. As she would always look after me when I was young, just as much as my actual older siblings.</p>
        <p>Now, I was literally at the front door of this air bnb at this moment. Group A was inside tending to ‘very drunk cousin’. Group B was outside calling out to me to come now as they were about to leave. What was my decision? Choose group A and fulfill values of Empathy, Service and Gratitude that ‘very drunk cousin’ showed me while growing up. Or choose group B and fulfill values of Fun, Enjoyment and Family with my other cousins. None of us have any negative relationships with each other or despise another, we were all on good terms. What was my decision? 
          I chose group B. Do I regret it? Yeah. Would I do it again? No. But at the same time, if I hadn't picked group B I wouldn’t have been aware of how valuable choosing group A’s values was. If I had picked group A, I would then have been in a different state where I would believe Group B’s values were more Valuable.</p>
        <p>Thinking about my situation was always tough when I thought about it, until this question came up. I realize almost all decisions are heavily influenced by emotion at the time and we easily tend to forget our own Identity and values to put in account. I now learn that if a similar situation comes about, I will weigh which values are more important to me.</p>

    <h2>Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.</h2>
    <p>I come from a Polynesian and Christian culture or background. These are also communities I was around too, so I lived and grew up with Polynesians and Christians all around me; all my life tbh. I learned while growing up that both these cultures have heavily influenced not only me but other people in their communities.</p>
    <p>These cultures showed me the people all had a sense of Solidarity. That the act of working together is what they needed to not only help one another, but achieve a common interest. I looked up to those in the church who would make sure the service ran smoothly in the background or how those that excelled in the polynesian community; only achieved through the support of the people around them. There's so many examples I could say and also so many other values I could pick out. But indefinitely, just living day to day around my cultures and the people around me, within those communities; help me to remember the person I am and/or the person I want to become.</p>

    <h2>Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.</h2>
    <p>I think my strengths would be Open-Mindedness and Willingness. I’m always open to new ideas and usually wanting to see others perspectives to really get my own grasp on a hard idea or concept. I think this will help on my learning journey as it helps me to critically think and adapt to the hard learning concepts in the future.</p>
    <p>A lot of the learning process will definitely have a lot of challenges and setbacks along the way. A lot of people don’t understand that you really need to persevere in those times of mistakes and failures. You really need a willingness to learn from mistakes, take on the chin and bounce back.</p>

    <h2>Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?</h2>
    <p>One might be work-life or learn-life (lol) balance. I’m pretty family oriented, I do stop studying from time to time to help out with whoever needs help around the house. And no doubt if I was at work, I would drop anything over a family emergency; no matter what. Being aware of this, I do understand it may hinder my learning time or put me off track if I frequently behave this way during the day.</p>
    <p>Another might be financial constraints. Simply, if I don’t manage my money efficiently while being unemployed and studying. I’m dead. Can’t pay rent, can’t buy food, can’t get internet. I can’t do anything during this whole course if I don’t have the proper finances in check.</p>

    <h2>Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</h2>
    <p>I remember my old warehousing 9-5 job, and we always had Invoicing at the end of the week. We had a 3 man team at the warehouse, but we only had one invoicing computer. If we finished the invoicing before finish time, we could go home early. One of us wanted to finish the invoicing fast, but that would more likely create errors in the invoicing. I, on the other-hand, wanted to do it slow and steady so there's less likely of any errors. Boss man was the third man to make sure there were no errors and was always last to leave.</p>
    <p>Fast dude, cared about wanting to finish early; more than the errors he made along the way. He couldn't understand that and why I would go slow and steady. This made him annoyed with me, just because we had different ideas of doing the same thing. He started viewing me as useless and inept. Which felt disruptive during the working day. I really tried to teach him the errors that came about without pointing out the ones he would make. But he seemed too proud of himself to admit to an error he could make.</p>
    <p>I look back and I’m pretty sure I did the right thing to do in general. Maybe I could have helped him realize his errors  in a more positive way. Like giving out a little analytical stat on his errors as he progressed. Like ‘last week you made x amount of errors compared to the week before that, you're making good progress. Now you should beat last week's score on errors’. This would express some appreciation and better peer relationships from before.</p>
