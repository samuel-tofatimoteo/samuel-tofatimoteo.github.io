        <h2>1. What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h2>
        <p>
          To buy a house. Yep, pretty simple. From my financial status It’s going to be  long term in the time to achieve that goal. Along that pathway, I believe choosing a career in tech/coding is going to help me get to my goal.
        </p>
        <h2>2. A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h2>
        <p>
          I think my strengths would be Open-Mindedness and Willingness. I’m always open to new ideas and usually wanting to see others perspectives to really get my own grasp on a hard idea or concept. I think this will help on my learning journey as it helps me to critically think and adapt to the hard learning concepts in the future.
        </p>
        <h2>3. What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h2>
        <p>
          Probably Innovative thinking. Like I suck at coming up with Ideas in group projects or working with a group. When it comes to problem solving, I have no creativity to input any options or ways to solve something. Hopefully surrounding myself around people who are, will alleast give me some confidence and ideas when it comes to me in similar situations.
        </p>
        <h2>4. A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.</h2>
        <p>
          I am going to manage the workload by maintaining my work-life or study/life balance. I feel like if I have clear boundaries on work and personal time, then it will be smooth sailing throughout the programme. Having that healthy balance brings a positive mood when it comes to work productivity and others around. Committing to a work-life balance helps me allocate time for hobbies, exercise and relaxation to prevent burnout when things build up during the programme.
        </p>
        <h2>5. A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.</h2>
        <p>
          Usually just self-assessing the workload or challenges along the way. Just going back and identifying areas where I definitely need support/assistance from someone else. I would seek out facilitators and other peers on the subject through discord. If not I would look online for a solution with my similar problem.
        </p>
        <h2>6. A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team.</h2>
        <p>
          Genuine support. Effectively and respectfully. It would be frustrating if the facilitators didn’t, like it is in their name to ‘facilitate’, us through the programme. Just creating a supportive environment that helps everyone with their challenges in a positive way.
        </p>
        <h2>7. Commitments.</h2>
        <p>
          I have prepared pretty well on my end (I think), in preparation for the course. Definitely set my own boundaries and sorted any conflicts with the programme. But probably the only absolute over anything that would affect my time during course, would be family emergencies. I’m very family oriented and would drop anything for them, that’s just the person I am. But very rarely anything that important would come about.
